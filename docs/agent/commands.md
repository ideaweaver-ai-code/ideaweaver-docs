# Agent Commands

IdeaWeaver provides a comprehensive set of agent commands for various tasks. Each command is designed to leverage the power of AI agents to accomplish specific goals.

## LLM Requirements and Dependencies

IdeaWeaver's agent system is designed to work with multiple language model providers, with a preference for local models through Ollama for cost-effective operation.

### Ollama Setup (Recommended)

Ollama is the preferred LLM provider for IdeaWeaver agents. It provides:
- Free, local model inference
- No API costs
- Privacy and data security
- Offline operation capability

To set up Ollama:

1. Install Ollama:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   
   # Linux
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Start the Ollama service:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

3. Pull a recommended model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull phi3:mini  # Fast and efficient
   # or
   ollama pull llama2:7b  # More capable but larger
   ```

### OpenAI Fallback

If Ollama is not available, IdeaWeaver will automatically fall back to using OpenAI's API. Please note:

- OpenAI usage incurs costs based on token consumption
- API key is required (set via OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable)
- Internet connection is required
- Usage is subject to OpenAI's rate limits and terms of service

To use OpenAI:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

### Checking LLM Status

You can verify your LLM setup at any time:
```bash
ideaweaver agent check-llm
```

This will show:
- Available Ollama models (if installed)
- OpenAI API status (if configured)
- Current active provider
- Connection status
